# Project Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
- âœ… Created project structure for frontend and backend
- âœ… Created project documentation (README, Project Rules, Project Plan)
- âœ… Set up Python backend with FastAPI
- âœ… Set up React frontend with TypeScript
- âœ… Configured routing and basic UI components

### Phase 2: Data Management
- âœ… Defined database models using SQLAlchemy
- âœ… Implemented file monitoring system with watchdog
- âœ… Created data parsing and validation for CSV files
- âœ… Implemented data anonymization with SHA-256 hashing

### Phase 3: Backend Analysis Features
- âœ… Implemented basic network analysis algorithms:
  - âœ… Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
  - âœ… Community detection (louvain, label propagation, girvan-newman)
  - âœ… Link prediction (common neighbors, jaccard, adamic adar, preferential attachment)
- âœ… Implemented API endpoints for analysis features
- âœ… Created network metrics calculation
- âœ… Implemented GNN-based intelligent link prediction model
- âœ… Implemented GNN-based user behavior prediction model

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
- âœ… Set up basic UI components (Header, Sidebar)
- âœ… Implemented network visualization with D3.js
- âœ… Created analysis configuration forms
- âœ… Implemented dashboard for metrics display
- âœ… Added link prediction visualization and UI
- âœ… Added user behavior prediction visualization and UI

### Phase 5: Testing
- âœ… Created basic unit tests for GNN models
- âœ… Added unit tests for user behavior prediction model

## In Progress Tasks

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
- ðŸ”„ Implement additional advanced UI features and interactions
- ðŸ”„ Add more detailed visualizations for network metrics

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- ðŸ”„ Optimize performance for large networks
- ðŸ”„ Add integration tests between frontend and backend
- ðŸ”„ Add more comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Complete advanced visualization features
2. Optimize model performance for large networks
3. Add additional comprehensive documentation
4. Complete integration testing between frontend and backend

## How to Run the Project

### Backend

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python ../run_backend.py
```

### Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Run the development server
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided scripts:

```bash
# For backend
python run_backend.py

# For frontend
python run_frontend.py
```

## Testing the System

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Place a CSV file in the `data/input` directory (or use the provided sample)
3. Open the frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Navigate to the Network View to see the visualization
5. Try different analysis algorithms in the Analysis page
