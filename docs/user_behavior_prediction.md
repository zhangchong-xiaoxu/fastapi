# User Behavior Prediction with GNN

This documentation covers the Graph Neural Network (GNN) based user behavior prediction feature in the Social Network Analysis System.

## Overview

The user behavior prediction feature uses Graph Neural Networks to predict which users are likely to be most active or influential in a social network based on their position and connections within the network structure. This can help identify key community members and potential influencers.

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture

The user behavior prediction system is built on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that consists of:

1. **GATConv Layers**: Learns node representations by attending to neighborhood features
2. **Prediction Head**: MLP layers that convert node embeddings to activity scores
3. **Data Processing**: Converts network data to formats suitable for neural network training

### Training Methodology

In the current implementation, the model is trained using node degree as a proxy for activity level, based on the principle that more connected users tend to be more active. In a production environment, this could be enhanced with:

- Historical activity data
- Engagement metrics
- Content production volume
- Interaction frequency

### API Endpoint

The behavior prediction functionality is exposed through the following API endpoint:

- **POST /api/analysis/predict-user-activity**: Predicts user activity levels based on network structure
  - Request body: Network data in JSON format (nodes and edges)
  - Query parameters: `top_k` to specify the number of predictions to return
  - Response: Array of users with predicted activity scores

## Frontend Integration

The user behavior prediction feature is integrated into the Analysis page with the following components:

1. **Prediction Button**: Triggers the user behavior prediction analysis
2. **Activity Table**: Displays predicted activity levels with visual indicators
3. **Activity Legend**: Provides interpretation of different activity levels
4. **Interpretation Guide**: Helps users understand how to use the predictions

## Usage

To use the user behavior prediction feature:

1. Navigate to the Analysis page
2. Click the "Predict User Activity" button
3. Review the predicted activity levels in the table
4. Use the "View" button to focus on specific users
5. Refer to the interpretation guide for insights on how to leverage these predictions

## Technical Details

### GAT Architecture Benefits

Graph Attention Networks offer several advantages for user behavior prediction:

1. **Attention Mechanism**: Learns which neighbors are more important for predicting behavior
2. **Inductive Learning**: Can generalize to unseen nodes and graph structures
3. **Node Feature Integration**: Can incorporate node attributes for richer predictions
4. **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide some insight into prediction reasoning

### Performance Considerations

The current implementation:

- Uses a simplified training approach for quick inference
- Employs attention mechanisms to focus on relevant connections
- Normalizes predictions for easier interpretation
- Limits training epochs for responsiveness

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the user behavior prediction feature include:

1. **Integration with real activity data**: Using actual user engagement metrics for more accurate training
2. **Temporal behavior modeling**: Incorporating time-based features to predict changing behavior
3. **Multi-task prediction**: Predicting multiple behavior patterns simultaneously
4. **Explainable AI components**: Providing rationales for predictions
5. **Feature importance visualization**: Showing which network factors contribute most to predictions

## Dependencies

The user behavior prediction feature relies on:

- torch
- torch-geometric (specifically GAT implementation)
- networkx
- numpy
